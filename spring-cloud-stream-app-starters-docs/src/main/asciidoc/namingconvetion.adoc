== App Starter Naming Conventions

The `spring-cloud-stream-app-maven-plugin` plugin (used to  generate the apps) defines certain naming conventions
about app starter resources. This convention is spread across numerous folder names, package and class names, properties
and pom attributes.

The following diagram aims to provide a unified view on all resources involved in the convention

The `[type]` placeholder represents the application type and must be either `Source`, `Processor` or `Sink` values.
The `[my-app-name]` placeholder represents the name of your app starter project.
For multi-word app names, the hyphens (`-`) is used as word delimiter (e.g. `my-app-name`). Mind that for `package names`
 the hyphen delimiter is replaced by (`.`) character (e.g. `o.s.c.s.a.my.app.name`). Class name convention expects
CamelCase names in place of any delimiters (e.g. `MyAppNameSourceConfiguration`.

The capital letters in the placeholders are relevant. For example the `[type]` refers to lower case names such as
`source`, `processor` or `sink` types, while capitalized placeholder `[Type]` refers to names like `Source`,
`Processor` and `Sink`.

The `Configuration` and `Properties` class suffixes are expected as well.


With the help of the maven plugin configuration all default conventions can be customized or replaced.
