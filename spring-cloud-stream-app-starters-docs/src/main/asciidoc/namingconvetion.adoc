== App Starter Naming Conventions

The `spring-cloud-stream-app-maven-plugin` (used to  generate the Pre-build Apps) asserts a naming convention over
certain starter's resources.

Following diagram describes which resources are involved and how the convention is applied to them.

The `[type]` placeholder represents the application type and must be either `Source`, `Processor` or `Sink` values.
The `[my-app-name]` placeholder represents the name of your app starter project.
For multi-word app names, the hyphens (`-`) is used as word delimiter (e.g. `my-app-name`). Mind that for `package names`
 the hyphen delimiter is replaced by (`.`) character (e.g. `o.s.c.s.a.my.app.name`). Class name convention expects
CamelCase names in place of any delimiters (e.g. `MyAppNameSourceConfiguration`.

The capital letters in the placeholders are relevant. For example the `[type]` refers to lower case names such as
`source`, `processor` or `sink` types, while capitalized placeholder `[Type]` refers to names like `Source`,
`Processor` and `Sink`.

The `Configuration` and `Properties` class suffixes are expected as well.

With the help of the maven plugin configuration all default conventions can be customized or replaced.
