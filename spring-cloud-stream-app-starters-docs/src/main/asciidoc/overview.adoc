[[overview]]

This section will provide you with a detailed overview of Spring Cloud Stream Application Starters, their purpose, and how to use them.
It assumes familiarity with general Spring Cloud Stream concepts, which can be found in the Spring Cloud Stream https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-stream/{scst-core-version}/[reference documentation].

== Introduction

Spring Cloud Stream Application Starters provide you with out-of-the-box Spring Cloud Stream uility applications that you can run independently or with Spring Cloud Data Flow.
You can also use the starters as a basis for creating your own applications.

They include:

* connectors (sources, processors, and sinks) for a variety of middleware technologies including message brokers, storage (relational, non-relational, filesystem);
* adapters for various network protocols;
* generic processors that can be customized via https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/expressions.html[Spring Expression Language (SpEL)] or scripting.

You can find a detailed listing of all the starters and as their options in the <<starters,corresponding>> section of this guide.

You can find all available app starter repositories in this https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters[GitHub Organization].

=== Pre-built applications

As a user of Spring Cloud Stream Application Starters you have access to two types of artifacts.

_Starters_ are libraries that contain the complete configuration of a Spring Cloud Stream application with a specific role (e.g. an _HTTP source_ that receives HTTP POST requests and forwards the data on its output channel to downstream Spring Cloud Stream applications).
Starters are _not_ executable applications, and are intended to be included in other Spring Boot applications, along with an available Binder implementation of your choice.

_Out-of-the-box applications_ are Spring Boot applications that include the starters and a Binder implementation - a fully functional uber-jar.
These https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/getting-started.html#getting-started-first-application-executable-jar[uber-jar's] include minimal code required to execute standalone. For each starter application, the project provides a prebuilt version for Apache Kafka and Rabbit MQ Binders.

[NOTE]
Only starters are present in the source code of the project.
Prebuilt applications are generated according to the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-app-starters-maven-plugins/tree/master/spring-cloud-stream-app-maven-plugin[stream apps generator maven plugin].

[[classification]]
=== Classification

Based on their target application type, starters can be either:

* a _source_ that connects to an external resource to poll and receive data that is published to the default "output" channel;
* a _processor_ that receives data from an "input" channel and processes it, sending the result on the default "output" channel;
* a _sink_ that connects to an external resource to send the received data to the default "input" channel.

You can easily identify the type and functionality of a starter based on its name.
All starters are named following the convention `spring-cloud-starter-stream-<type>-<functionality>`.
For example `spring-cloud-starter-stream-source-file` is a starter for a _file source_ that polls a directory and sends file data on the output channel (read <<spring-cloud-stream-modules-file-source,the reference documentation of the source>> for details).
Conversely, `spring-cloud-starter-stream-sink-cassandra` is a starter for a _Cassandra sink_ that writes the data that it receives on the input channel to Cassandra (read <<spring-cloud-stream-modules-cassandra-sink,the reference documentation of the sink>> for details).

The prebuilt applications follow a naming convention too: `<functionality>-<type>-<binder>`. For example, `cassandra-sink-kafka-10` is a _Cassandra sink_ using the Kafka binder that is running with Kafka version 0.10.

=== Using the Artifacts

You either get access to the artifacts produced by Spring Cloud Stream Application Starters via Maven, Docker, or building the artifacts yourself.

==== Maven and Docker access

Starters are available as Maven artifacts in the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Spring-Artifactory[Spring repositories]. You can add them as dependencies to your application, as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud.stream.app</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-sink-cassandra</artifactId>
  <version>2.1.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

From this, you can infer the coordinates for other starters found in this guide.
While the version may vary, the group will always remain `org.springframework.cloud.stream.app` and the artifact id follows the naming convention `spring-cloud-starter-stream-<type>-<functionality>` described <<classification,previously>>.

Prebuilt applications are available as Maven artifacts too.
It is not encouraged to use them directly as dependencies, as starters should be used instead.
Following the typical Maven `<group>:<artifactId>:<version>` convention, they can be referenced for example as:

----
org.springframework.cloud.stream.app:cassandra-sink-rabbit:2.1.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
----

You can download the executable jar artifacts from the Spring Maven repositories.  The root directory of the Maven repository that hosts release versions is https://repo.spring.io/release/org/springframework/cloud/stream/app/.  From there you can navigate to the latest release version of a specific app, for example link:https://repo.spring.io/release/org/springframework/cloud/stream/app/log-sink-rabbit/2.0.2.RELEASE/log-sink-rabbit-1.1.1.RELEASE.jar[log-sink-rabbit-2.0.2.RELEASE.jar].  Use the link:https://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/cloud/stream/app[Milestone] and link:https://repo.spring.io/snapshot/org/springframework/cloud/stream/app[Snapshot] repository locations for Milestone and Snapshot executable jar artifacts.

The Docker versions of the applications are available in Docker Hub, at `https://hub.docker.com/r/springcloudstream/`. Naming and versioning follows the same general conventions as Maven, e.g.

[source,bash]
----
docker pull springcloudstream/cassandra-sink-kafka
----

will pull the _latest_ Docker image of the _Cassandra sink_ with the Kafka binder.

==== Building the Artifacts

You can build the project and generate the artifacts (including the prebuilt applications) on your own.
This is useful if you want to deploy the artifacts locally or add additional features.

First, you need to generate the prebuilt applications.
This is done by running the application generation Maven plugin.
You can do so by simply invoking the maven build with the generateApps profile and install lifecycle.

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install -PgenerateApps
----

Each of the prebuilt applciation will contain:

* `pom.xml` file with the required dependencies (starter and binder)
* a class that contains the `main` method of the application and imports the predefined configuration
* generated integration test code that validates the component against the configured binder.

For example, `spring-cloud-starter-stream-sink-cassandra` will generate `cassandra-sink-rabbit` and `cassandra-sink-kafka` as completely functional applications.

=== Custom Artifacts

Apart from accessing the sources, sinks and processors already provided by the project, in this section we will describe how to:

* Use a different binder than Kafka or Rabbit
* Create your own applications
* Customize dependencies such as Hadoop distributions or JDBC drivers

[[customizing-binder]]
==== Using a different binder

Prebuilt applications are provided for both kafka and rabbit binders.
But if you want to connect to a different middleware system, and you have a binder for it, you will need to create new artifacts.

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
  <!- other dependencies -->
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud.stream.app</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-sink-cassandra</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-kinesis</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

The next step is to create the project's main class and import the configuration provided by the starter.

[source,java]
----
package org.springframework.cloud.stream.app.cassandra.sink.rabbit;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.stream.app.cassandra.sink.CassandraSinkConfiguration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Import;


@SpringBootApplication
@Import(CassandraSinkConfiguration.class)
public class CassandraSinkKinesisApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(CassandraSinkKinesisApplication.class, args);
	}
}
----

==== New Applications

Spring Cloud Stream Application Starters consists of regular Spring Boot applications with some additional conventions that facilitate generating prebuilt applications with the preconfigured binders.
Sometimes, your solution may require additional applications that are not in the scope of out-of-the-box Spring Cloud Stream Application Starters, or require additional tweaks and enhancements.
In this section we will show you how to create custom applications that can be part of your solution, along with Spring Cloud Stream application starters.
You have the following options:

* create new Spring Cloud Stream applications;
* use the starters to create customized versions;

===== Generic Applications

If you want to add your own custom applications to your solution, you can simply create a new Spring Cloud Stream app project with the binder of your choice and run it the same way as the applications provided by Spring Cloud Stream Application Starters, independently or via Spring Cloud Data Flow.
The process is described in the https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-stream/{scst-core-version}/single/spring-cloud-stream.html#_quick_start[Quick Start] section of Spring Cloud Stream.

In a nutshell, you can go to the https://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr] and choose a Spring Cloud Stream Binder of your choice.
This way you already have the necessary infrastructure ready to go and mainly focus on the specifics of the application.

The following requirements need to be followed when you go with this option:

* a single inbound channel named `output` for sources - the simplest way to do so is by using the predefined interface `org.spring.cloud.stream.messaging.Source`;
* a single outbound channel named `input` for sinks - the simplest way to do so is by using the predefined interface `org.spring.cloud.stream.messaging.Sink`;
* both an inbound channel named `input` and an outbound channel named `output` for processors - the simplest way to do so is by using the predefined interface `org.spring.cloud.stream.messaging.Processor`.

===== Customize Starter Applications

You can also reuse the starters provided by Spring Cloud Stream Application Starters to create custom components, enriching the behavior of the application.
For example, you can add a Spring Security layer to your _HTTP source_, add additional configurations to the `ObjectMapper` used for JSON transformation wherever that happens, or change the JDBC driver or Hadoop distribution that the application is using.
In order to do this, you should set up your project following a process similar to <<customizing-binder,customizing a binder>>.
In fact, customizing the binder is the simplest form of creating a custom component.

As a reminder, this involves:

* adding the starter to your project
* choosing the binder
* adding the main class and importing the starter configuration.

After doing so, you can add the additional configuration for the extra features of your application.

=== Patching Pre-built Applications

If you're looking to patch the pre-built applications to accommodate the addition of new dependencies, you can use the following example as the reference. Let's review the steps to add `mysql` driver to `jdbc-sink` application.

* Go to: https://start-scs.cfapps.io/
* Select the application and binder dependencies [_`JDBC sink` and `Rabbit binder starter`_]
* Generate and load the project in an IDE
* Add `mysql` java-driver dependency

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <version>5.1.37</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud.stream.app</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-sink-jdbc</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

* Import the respective configuration _class_ to the generated Spring Boot application. In the case of `jdbc` sink, it is: `@Import(org.springframework.cloud.stream.app.jdbc.sink.JdbcSinkConfiguration.class)`. You can find the configuration _class_ for other applications in their respective https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters[repositories].

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@Import(org.springframework.cloud.stream.app.jdbc.sink.JdbcSinkConfiguration.class)
public class DemoApplication {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
  }
}
----

* Build and install the application to desired maven repository
* The patched copy of `jdbc-sink` application now includes `mysql` driver in it
* This application can be run as a standalone _uberjar_

=== Creating New Stream Application Starters and Generating Artifacts

In this section, we will explain how to develop a custom source/sink/processor application and then generate
maven and docker artifacts for it with the necessary middleware bindings using the existing tooling provided by the
spring cloud stream app starter infrastructure. For explanation purposes, we will assume that we are creating a new
source application for a technology named foobar.

* Create a repository called foobar in your local github account

* The root artifact (something like foobar-app-starters-build) must inherit from `app-starters-build`

Please follow the instructions above for designing a proper Spring Cloud Stream Source. You may also look into the existing
starters for how to structure a new one. The default naming for the main `@Configuration` class is
`FoobarSourceConfiguration` and the default package for this `@Configuration`
is `org.springfamework.cloud.stream.app.foobar.source`. If you have a different class/package name, see below for
overriding that in the app generator. The technology/functionality name for which you create
a starter can be a hyphenated stream of strings such as in `scriptable-transform` which is a processor type in the
module `spring-cloud-starter-stream-processor-scriptable-transform`.

The starters in `spring-cloud-stream-app-starters` are slightly different from the other starters in spring-boot and
spring-cloud in that here we don't provide a way to auto configure any configuration through spring factories mechanism.
Rather, we delegate this responsibility to the maven plugin that is generating the binder based apps. Therefore, you don't
have to provide a `spring.factories` file that lists all your configuration classes.

* The starter module needs to inherit from the parent (`foobar-app-starters-build`)

* Add the new foobar source module to the root pom of the new repository

* In the pom.xml for the source module, add the following in the `build` section. This will add the necessary plugin configuration for app generation as well as generating proper documentation metadata.
Please ensure that your root pom inherits https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/core/blob/master/pom.xml[app-starters-build] as the base configuration for the plugins is specified there.

[source,xml]
----
<build>
		<plugins>
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
				<artifactId>spring-cloud-app-starter-doc-maven-plugin</artifactId>
			</plugin>
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.springframework.cloud.stream.app.plugin</groupId>
				<artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-app-maven-plugin</artifactId>
				<configuration>
					<generatedProjectHome>${session.executionRootDirectory}/apps</generatedProjectHome>
					<generatedProjectVersion>${project.version}</generatedProjectVersion>
					<bom>
						<name>scs-bom</name>
						<groupId>org.springframework.cloud.stream.app</groupId>
						<artifactId>foobar-app-dependencies</artifactId>
						<version>${project.version}</version>
					</bom>
					<generatedApps>
						<foobar-source/>
					</generatedApps>
				</configuration>
			</plugin>
		</plugins>
	</build>
----

More information about the maven plugin used above to generate the apps can be found here:
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-app-maven-plugin

If you did not follow the default convention expected by the plugin for where it is looking for the main configuration
class, which is `org.springfamework.cloud.stream.app.foobar.source.FoobarSourceConfiguration`, you can override that in
the configuration for the plugin. For example, if your main configuration class is `foo.bar.SpecialFooBarConfiguration.class`,
this is how you can tell the plugin to override the default.

[source,xml]
----
<foobar-source>
    <autoConfigClass>foo.bar.SpecialFooBarConfiguration.class</autoConfigClass>
</foobar-source>
----


* Create a new module to manage dependencies for foobar (`foobar-app-dependencies`). This is the bom (bill of material) for this project. It is advised that this bom is inherited from `spring-cloud-dependencies-parent`. Please see other starter repositories for guidelines.

* You need to add the new starter dependency to the BOM in the dependency management section. For example,

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
...
...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud.stream.app</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-source-foobar</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
...
...
----

* At the root of the repository build, install and generate the apps:

`./mvnw clean install -PgenerateApps`

This will generate the binder based foobar source apps in a directory named `apps` at the root of the repository.
If you want to change the location where the apps are generated, for instance ``/tmp/scst-apps`, you can do it in the
configuration section of the plugin.

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
    ...
    <generatedProjectHome>/tmp/scst-apps</generatedProjectHome>
    ...
</configuration
----

By default, we generate apps for both Kafka and Rabbitmq binders - `spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka` and
`spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit`. Say, if you have a custom binder you created for some middleware (E.g. JMS),
which you need to generate apps for foobar source, you can add that binder to the binders list in the configuration
section as in the following.

[source,xml]
----
<binders>
    <jms />
</binders>
----

Please note that this will only work, as long as there is a binder with the maven coordinates of
`org.springframework.cloud.stream` as group id and `spring-cloud-stream-binder-jms` as artifact id.
This artifact needs to be specified in the BOM above and available through a maven repository as well.

If you have an artifact that is only available through a private internal maven repository (may be an enterprise wide
Nexus repo that you use globally across teams), and you need that for your app, you can define that as part of the maven
plugin configuration.

For example,

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
...
    <extraRepositories>
        <repository>
            <id>private-internal-nexus</id>
            <url>.../</url>
            <name>...</name>
            <snapshotEnabled>...</snapshotEnabled>
        </repository>
    </extraRepositories>
</configuration>
----

Then you can define this as part of your app tag:

[source,xml]
----
<foobar-source>
    <extraRepositories>
        <private-internal-nexus />
    </extraRepositories>
</foobar-source>
----

* cd into the directory where you generated the apps (`apps` at the root of the repository by default, unless you changed
it elsewhere as described above).

Here you will see `foobar-source-kafka` and `foobar-source-rabbit`.
If you added more binders as described above, apps will be generated for them as well - e.g. foobar-source-jms.

You can import these apps directly into your IDE of choice if you further want to do any customizations on them. Each of them is a self contained spring boot application project.
For the generated apps, the parent is `spring-boot-starter-parent` as required by the underlying Spring Initializr library.

You can cd into these custom foobar-source directories and do the following to build the apps:

`cd foo-source-kafka`

`mvn clean install`

This installs the foo-source-kafka into your local maven cache (~/.m2 by default).

The app generation phase adds an integration test to the app project that is making sure that all the spring
components and contexts are loaded properly. However, these tests are not run by default when you do a `mvn install`.
You can force the running of these tests by doing the following:

`mvn clean install -DskipTests=false`

**One important note about running these tests in generated apps:**

If your application's spring beans need to interact with
some real services out there or expect some properties to be present in the context, these tests will fail unless you make
those things available. An example would be a Twitter Source, where the underlying spring beans are trying to create a
twitter template and will fail if it can't find the credentials available through properties. One way to solve this and
still run the generated context load tests would be to create a mock class that provides these properties or mock beans
(for example, a mock twitter template) and tell the maven plugin about its existence. You can use the existing module
`app-starters-test-support` for this purpose and add the mock class there.
See the class `org.springframework.cloud.stream.app.test.twitter.TwitterTestConfiguration` for reference.
You can create a similar class for your foobar source - `FoobarTestConfiguration` and add that to the plugin configuration.
You only need to do this if you run into this particular issue of Spring beans are not created properly in the
integration test in the generated apps.

[source,xml]
----
<foobar-source>
    <extraTestConfigClass>org.springframework.cloud.stream.app.test.foobar.FoobarTestConfiguration.class</extraTestConfigClass>
</foobar-source>
----

When you do the above, this test configuration will automatically be imported into the context of your test class.

Also note that, you need to regenerate the apps each time you make a configuration change in the plugin.

* Now that you built the applications, they are available under the `target` directories of the respective apps and also as
maven artifacts in your local maven repository. Go to the `target` directory and run the following:

`java -jar foobar-source-kafa.jar` [Ensure that you have Apache Kafka running locally when you do this]

It should start the application up.

* The generated apps also support the creation of docker images. You can cd into one of the foobar-source* app and do the
following:

`mvn clean package docker:build`

This creates the docker image under the `target/docker/springcloudstream` directory. Please ensure that the Docker
container is up and running when executing the above Docker command.

All the generated apps from the various app repositories are uploaded to https://hub.docker.com/u/springcloudstream/[Docker Hub]

However, for a custom app that you build, this won't be uploaded to docker hub under `springcloudstream` repository.
If you think that there is a general need for this app, you should try contributing this starter as a new repository to https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters[Spring Cloud Stream App Starters].
Upon review, this app then can be eventually available through the above location in docker hub.

If you still need to push this to docker hub under a different repository (may be an enterprise repo that you manage for your organization) you can take the following steps.

Go to the pom.xml of the generated app [ example - `foo-source-kafka/pom.xml`]
Search for `springcloudstream`. Replace with your repository name.

Then do this:

`mvn clean package docker:build docker:push -Ddocker.username=[provide your username] -Ddocker.password=[provide password]`

This will upload the docker image to the docker hub in your custom repository.

=== General FAQ on Spring Cloud Stream App Starters

In the following sections, you can find a brief FAQ on various things that we discussed above and a few other infrastructure related topics.

. What are Spring Cloud Stream Application Starters? +
Spring Cloud Stream Application Starters are Spring Boot based Spring Integration applications that provide integration with external systems. GitHub: https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters +
Project page: https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/


. What is the parent for stream app starters? +
The parent for all app starters is `app-starters-build` which is coming from the core project. https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/core
For example:
+
[source,xml,subs=attributes]
----
&lt;parent&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud.stream.app&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;app-starters-build&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;{app-starters-build-version}&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;relativePath/&gt;
&lt;/parent&gt;
----

. Why is there a BOM in the core proejct? +
Core defines a BOM which contains all the dependency management for common artifacts. This BOM is named as `app-starters-core-dependencies`.
 We need this bom during app generation to pull down all the core dependencies.

. What are the contents of the core BOM? +
In addition to the common artifacts in core, the app-starters-core-dependencies BOM also adds dependency management for spring-cloud-dependencies which will include spring-cloud-stream transitively.

. Where is the core BOM used? +
There are two places where the core BOM is used. It is used to provide compile time dependency management for all the starters.
This is defined in the `app-starters-build` artfiact. This same BOM is referenced through the maven plugin configuration for the app generation.
The generated apps thus will include this bom also in their pom.xml files.

. What spring cloud stream artifacts does the parent artifact (`app-starters-build`) include? +
* spring-cloud-stream
* Spring-cloud-stream-test-support-internal
* spring-cloud-stream-test-support

. What other artfiacts are available through the parent `app-starters-build` and where are they coming from? +
In addition to the above artifacts, the artifacts below also included in `app-starters-build` by default.
* json-path
* spring-integration-xml
* spring-boot-starter-logging
* spring boot-starter-security +
Spring-cloud-build is the parent for app-starters-build. Spring-cloud-build imports spring-boot-dependencies and that is from where these artifacts are coming from.

. I did not see any other Spring Integration components used in the above 2 lists. Where are those dependencies coming from for individual starters? +
Spring-integration bom is imported in the spring-boot-dependencies bom and this is where the default SI dependencies are coming for SCSt app starters.

. Can you summarize all the BOM's that SCSt app starters depend on? +
All SCSt app starters have access to dependencies defined in the following BOM’s and other dependencies from any other BOM’s these three boms import transitively as in the case of Spring Integration:
    * app-starters-core-dependencies
    * spring-cloud-dependencies
    * spring-boot-dependencies

.  Each app starter has `app-starter-build` as the parent which in turn has `spring-cloud-build` as parent. The above documentation states that the
generated apps have `spring-boot-starter` as the parent. Why the mismatch? +
There is no mismatch per se, but a slight subtlety. As the question frames, each app starter has access to artifacts managed all the way through `spring-cloud-build` at compile time.
However, this is not the case for the generated apps at runtime. Generated apps are managed by boot. Their parent is `spring-boot-starter` that imports `spring-boot-dependencies` bom that includes a majority of the components that these apps need.
The additional dependencies that the generated application needs are managed by including a BOM specific to each application starter.

.  Why is there an app starter specific BOM in each app starer repositories? For example, `time-app-dependencies`. +
This is an important BOM. At runtime, the generated apps get the versions used in their dependencies through a BOM that is managing the dependencies. Since all the boms
that we specified above only for the helper artifacts, we need a place to manage the starters themselves. This is where the app specific BOM comes into play.
In addition to this need, as it becomes clear below, there are other uses for this BOM such as dependency overrides etc. But in a nutshell, all the starter dependencies go to this BOM.
For instance, take TCP repo as an example. It has a starter for source, sink, client processor etc. All these dependencies are managed through the app specific `tcp-app-dependencies` bom.
This bom is provided to the app generator maven plugin in addition to the core bom. This app specific bom has `spring-cloud-dependencies-parent` as parent.

.  How do I create a new app starter project? +
If you have a general purpose starter that can be provided as an of of the box app, create an issue for that in https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/app-starters-release[app-starters-release].
If there is a consensus, then a repository can be created in the `spring-cloud-stream-app-starters` organization where you can start contributing the starters and other components.

.  I created a new starter according to the guidelines above, now how do I generate binder specific apps for the new starters? +
By default, the app-starters-build in core is configured with the common configuration needed for the app generator maven plugin. It is configured for generating apps for kafka-09, kafka-10 and rabbitmq binders.
In your starter you already have the configuration specified for the plugin from the parent. Modify the configuration for your starter accordingly. Refer to an existing starter for guidelines.
Here is an example of modifying such a configuration : https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/time/blob/master/spring-cloud-starter-stream-source-time/pom.xml
Look for spring-cloud-stream-app-maven-plugin in the plugins section under build.
You generate binder based apps using the generateApps maven profile. You need the maven install lifecycle to generate the apps.


.  How do I override Spring Integration version that is coming from spring-boot-dependencies by default? +
The following solution only works if the versions you want to override are available through a new Spring Integration BOM.
Go to your app starter specific bom. Override the property as following:

 <spring-integration.version>VERSION GOES HERE</spring-integration.version>

 Then add the following in the dependencies management section in the BOM.

 <dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.integration</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-integration-bom</artifactId>
	<version>${spring-integration.version}</version>
	<scope>import</scope>

.  How do I override spring-cloud-stream artifacts coming by default in spring-cloud-dependencies defined in core BOM? +
The following solution only works if the versions you want to override are available through a new Spring-Cloud-Dependencies BOM.
Go to your app starter specific bom. Override the property as following:

 <spring-cloud-dependencies.version>VERSION GOES HERE</spring-cloud-dependencies.version>

 Then add the following in the dependencies management section in the BOM.

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
        <version>${spring-cloud-dependencies.version}</version>
        <scope>import</scope>
        <type>pom</type>
    </dependency>


.  What if there is no spring-cloud-dependencies BOM available that contains my versions of spring-cloud-stream, but there is a spring-cloud-stream BOM available? +
Go to your app starter specific BOM. Override the property as below.

 <spring-cloud-stream.version>VERSION GOES HERE</spring-cloud-stream.version>

 Then add the following in the dependencies management section in the BOM.

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-dependencies</artifactId>
        <version>${spring-cloud-stream.version}</version>
        <scope>import</scope>
        <type>pom</type>
    </dependency>

.  What if I want to override a single artifact that is provided through a bom? For example spring-integration-java-dsl? +
Go to your app starter BOM and add the following property with the version you want to override:

 <spring-integration-java-dsl.version>VERSION GOES HERE</spring-integration-java-dsl.version>

 Then in the dependency management section add the following:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.integration</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-integration-java-dsl</artifactId>
        <version>${spring-integration-java-dsl.version}</version>
    </dependency>

.  How do I override the boot version used in a particular app? +
When you generate the app, override the boot version as follows.

  ./mvnw clean install -PgenerateApps -DbootVersion=<boot version to override>

  For example: ./mvnw clean install -PgenerateApps -DbootVersion=2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT

You can also override the boot version more permanently by overriding the following property in your starter pom.

    <bootVersion>2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</bootVersion>
