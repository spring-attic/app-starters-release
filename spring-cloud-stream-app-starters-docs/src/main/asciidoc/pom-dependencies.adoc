The dependencies are grouped in three categories:

* *Core Spring libraries* - represent the core framework libraries such as `Spring Boot`, `Spring Integration`,
`Spring Cloud`. The "Bill Of Materials" (BOM) patterns is used throughout the stack to decouple the dependency
management from the lifecycle configurations.
The `app-starters-build` parent POM and  the `app-starters-core-dependencies` BOM use inherit by all app starters.

* *App Starters* - libraries that contain the complete configuration of a Spring Cloud Stream application with a specific role
Starters are not executable applications, and are intended to be included in the `Pre-build Apps`, along with a Binder
implementation.
The App Starter root pom (`[my-app-name]-app-starters-build`) inherit all compile-tme configuration for its parent
the core `app-starters-build`. Starer's BOM `[my-app-name]-app-dependencies` is used to manage starter's own dependencies.

* *Pre-build App* - pre-build Spring Boot applications that include the app starters and a Binder implementation.
