== App Starter POM Dependencies

Following diagram highlights the important App Starter POM dependencies.

The dependencies are grouped in three categories:

* *Core Spring Dependencies* - represent the core framework libraries such as `Spring Boot`, `Spring Integration`,
`Spring Cloud`. The "Bill Of Materials" (BOM) patterns is actively used throughout the stack to decouple the
dependency management for plugins and lifecycle configurations.
The `app-starters-build` and  the `app-starters-core-dependencies` BOM provide the generic `compile-time` dependencies
for the App Starters projects.

* *Specific App Starter Dependencies* - represent the starter applications. The root
`[my-app-name]-app-starters-build` pom inherits all compile-time configurations and BOM from the core parent
`app-starters-build`, while the `[my-app-name]-app-dependencies` BOM offers a place to manage the app specific dependencies.
In addition to the external libraries, the `[my-app-name]-app-dependencies` BOM manages the Apps projects dependencies
too (e.g. `spring-cloud-starters-stream-[type]-[my-app-name]`).
It is important to realize that the App Starter projects are not Spring Boot applications but used as seeds for the auto-generated Apps.

* *Generated Starter App* - represents the `run-time` starter artifacts generated from the Specific App Starters and
managed as `Spring Boot` applications. The `run-time` starter extends from Spring Boot parent and merges the configurations
of the `specific app`, `core app` as well as the `boot` BOMs (e.g. `[my-app-name]-app-dependencies`,
`app-starters-core-dependencies`, `spring-boot-dependencies`). The generated starter also includes specific starter
implementation as well as the required [binder] starter.
